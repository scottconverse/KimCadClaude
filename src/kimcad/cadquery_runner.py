"""CadQuery backend — the in-process (Python 3.14) side that drives the out-of-process
worker (spec §6.4/§12, Stage 8).

CadQuery is the **parallel geometry backend** to OpenSCAD: the LLM can emit either, and a
prompt OpenSCAD codegen fails on may succeed under CadQuery (and vice versa), so the union
lifts the done-gate. CadQuery also exports **STEP** — editable, parametric CAD geometry
OpenSCAD cannot produce.

CadQuery's OCCT backend has no Python-3.14 wheels, so it runs in a separate <=3.13
interpreter via :mod:`kimcad.cadquery_worker`, shelled out exactly like OpenSCAD/OrcaSlicer.
This module:

1. **Statically sanitizes** the untrusted generated script (the first of two security
   layers; the worker's restricted builtins are the second). It blocks — rather than
   strips — anything dangerous, so the orchestrator re-prompts and valid geometry is never
   silently mangled.
2. Writes the script to an isolated temp dir, invokes the worker with a timeout + output
   size guard, and returns the same :class:`~kimcad.openscad_runner.RenderResult` the
   pipeline already consumes from the OpenSCAD path — so the orient/harden/gate tail is
   identical regardless of backend.

The sanitizer is a pure function (token-based, so a banned word inside a string or comment
is not a false positive) and is unit-tested without the interpreter; only
:func:`render_cadquery` shells out.
